Notes for 6/12/2022:

-Next time demo the code
-Need to do unit and integration (mocking) tests
-Functional testing (3rd assignment) + write a document for these kind of tests

Feedback:

-Nice overview
-Each section of microservice, a bit more highlevel, a bit more simplified, less details (naming each method is not necesarily)
-A list of certifications would be nice
-One big UML diagram (not too complicated, search on google for an example)
-More explanations (why we chose to do it this way and not that way)
-Synchronous vs async to communicate between microservices (design choice)
-We need to specify which design patterns we chose (not sure tho)
-For the second part of the first assignment, there must be some code implemented (include 2 design patterns or more, but explain why did we choose these design patters)
-After Christmas break, multiple assignments regarding testing
-20th od Dec: optional meeting (online)
-No meetings after Christmas
-Overall microservices make sense
-Certificate microservice (maybe we could add it if it helps decoupling the code)
-Untrack certain files: remove it (but make sure that it works!)
-!!!Explain how we got to these microservices (why these ones and not other microservices) - very important (graded)!!!

Dedlines:

-For 16th of Dec: assignment 1 DEADLINE
-23rd of Dec: all of the code related to all the features (main functionality done) DEADLINE


Distribute tasks:

-Use gitlab for maybe milestones (estimation of how long it is going ot take)
-Rithnik moves the issues to gitlab
-Grade issues and distribute them
