## How to run it

### Requirements
Before running the application the user must make sure that their devices have the following requirements:
- The device must have Java SDK 17(or above) installed.
- The device must have Javafx-SDK-17.0.2 or a later version installed.
- The device must have Postman installed.

### Starting the backend
Through IntelliJ
- In the top right corner, add the configurations of the microservices.
- Using spring boot to start all the configurations.

### Accessing the Database
If you want to have a look at the database, please use the inside function of IntelliJ which is in the top right corner of the screen. After running spring boot, you can access the databases we are using for storing information.

### How to start
Before a user wants to let his friends join his rowing activity, he must create one by himself. Since we are using the Spring Security Service to make sure only "safe" users can access our system, the user has to register first. After registration, he can access the other 3 micro-services to actually experiencing our system.

#### Authentication-Microservice
